# Why documentation is important?
---

`Hello readers`,

Most of us including me as well find documentation as a boring stuff. 

Let's assume just for the sake of doing document we created a document for our project & we thought the project is done. 

In reality, the project is not complete without proper documentation. Let me tell you some examples to understand.


+ Consider a first scenario **(You don't create a document)**

Senior person assigns you one client project. You need to submit that project within the next 3 months, you start to work on it.
You didn't document anything about what you are doing in that project, the flow of the product, how to run/install product etc... Since you are working on it you might think, I know all about the project
if something goes wrong you know how to handle.

Now the time comes when we need to deploy the product to the end user. Here except you, nobody knows how to use the product.
The manager asks you for the document of it so that user can use the product.

What will you do? Will you say I know my product well so I didn't create the document for the product? (At that time and place your manager will fire you)

+ Consider a second Scenario **(You documented the project but at some of places you missed to document some points)**

You are working on your project you are documenting the points which you think it will be hard to understand and recall and missed some points which you think are easy to remember.
You completed that project, your manager hand over the product to the client with the document. All was going nice, but suddenly after 5-6 months, a minor bug occurs into your product.
The bug is from out of the syllabus. :D that means you read your all document but didn't get any clue on that bug. since you missed some points to mention. 

Isn't it a big headache? to recall the thing which you have done 5-6 months ago.

If you documented each and every small thing about the product you have been overcome the above problems.


### If you don't want to be in either of the above situations, start documenting things properly. :)
