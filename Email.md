## Email Basics

Hello readers, 


Many of us face the problem in email writing. How should we organize the email? What things we can avoid while writing
emails? What are our mistakes in email? These are the most common questions which comes to our mind. 
Let's try to find the answer of them in the following blog.

## Email Dos : 

+ Subject line must be clear and brief.

+ Do add words of appreciation, especially when making a request.

+ Keep email text size up to 2-3 paragraphs.

+ Use excerpts from previous messages to clarify what youâ€™re replying to.

+ Have a professional Email id.


**Bad ones** : `silentkiller@gmail.com, KrishSwimmeer@gmail.com`


**Good ones** : `krishnawaidande@gmail.com, swapnil@gmail.com`


## Email Don'ts

+ Make mistakes like spelling, grammar, punctuation, capitalization.

+ Write long emails. It should contain 2-3 paragraphs.

+ Complaint or blame in the email.

+ Address the email until it is written ( It means don't use send button until it is checked.)

+ Assume that everyone reads email immediately



## Points to remember :

+ After writing emails, come back and again read the whole email. Edit the words and try to short them.

+ Hava a clear order.

+ Avoid harsh words.

+ Never use passive voice mostly use active voice.

+ Never use extra words. Try to eliminate the extra words, we use more adjectives and adverbs. Don't use them.


While writing email most of us use the punctuations at wrong places and we never come to know about it, if we do not know
where to use them, as like I have used in this sentence. Also, most of us do not capitalization in the mail. We will discuss about it in the following segment of the blog.


## Puncatualization and Capitalization

+ Apostrophe **(')**

You can use an apostrophe in the context of possession it means Krishna's laptop, Swapnil's mobile.
Avoid using this in words like can't or wouldn't.


+ Commas **(,)**

If you pause there is where commas should go or you are listing something there should be comma used.

For example :

> My best friend, Joe, arrived.

> C, C++, Java are my favourite languages.

> In date October 10, 1018


+ Semicolon ;

Use semicolon when writing a series like Recent Olympic sites are `Pune, India; UK, London; US, America`.


+ Quotatation marks **(" ")**

> Do not use for emphasis

`I would "really" like to meet you. ( Do not use)`


> Use for direct speech only 
 

`He said, "I will come with you."`


+ Emoticons 

Don't use Emoticons in the email.

+ Capitalization :

Mostly we do a mistake like never use the first letter as a capital for nouns or word after a full stop or starting letter
of every new sentence.
For example :

Invalid: `redhat and ubuntu are popular flavours of linux operating system.`

Valid: `Redhat and Ubuntu are popular flavors of Linux operating system.`

Here Rehat, Ubuntu and Linux are proper nouns.

Invalid: `i will be coming late to the office.`

Valid: `I will be coming late to the office.`

Here the first letter of newline sentence should be capital.


I hope now the questioned which we raised earlier in the article are answered.
