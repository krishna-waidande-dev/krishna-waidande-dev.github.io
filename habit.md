## Wanna start a new habit?

Hi Reader,

Have you been in a situation where you desired to start to do something new from the daily routine like doing exercise, 
reading your fav comic books/novels, learning something new? but not able to getting started because of `not having enough time`.

I will share a similar kind of experience.

I was planning to start reading blogs on things that are unknown for me like money Investments, stock market, interesting facts about the world and many more. 
Only I was not able to decide when to do it. It was on my to-do list for so many days.


One of my colleagues suggests a simple way to get started. The technique is very simple.

>> Keep aside only 10-15 mins from your whole day.

>> Now do the task/thing which you have been avoiding due to time constraints.

>> Do it daily for at least a month. Be committed to it.

On one fine day, I was on my way to the office (via bus). The bus was stuck in traffic for a long time.
One of my friends shared one random post which I found interesting. At that time I decided why not start the daily blog reading when I am commuting. 

In this way, I started this new habit of reading blogs. You also try this simple way to start a habit. :)
