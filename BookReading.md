# How did I start to read books?

Hello Readers,

Most of you might have a hobby of reading books of various types like an autobiography, non-fiction, comic, etc. In my case, I never find a book reading compelling. In college life, I (we all) used to read a theory book and go for an exam. I never learned how I could practically use that theory. Maybe this thing leads me to feel like books are boring. Also, the size of the book is another reason for me to never like a book.

During my work, I face the problem of not able to communicate my idea to others or feel very under knowledged because sometimes my colleagues understood certain things very quickly, but I could not understand it immediately.

I realized I need to work on myself; I started watching interviews of successful peoples like Ambani, Jack Ma, Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk, etc. In some of their conversations, they mentioned one thing, which is how vital book reading is. (which is a mutual thing in all peoples)

We can get the experience of someone's life, key factors of their success, what mistakes they did during their process so we can avoid those mistakes. All this we can take only by reading the book and following the path. Isn't it an excellent thing/idea to learn from other's mistakes?

Lots of peoples are there who have changed their life, working style, became rich, became entrepreneurs only by reading books and learning from it.

A few days back, for the first time, I completed a book named "Rework" by Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson. (difficult to pronounce, right?).

I will share a summary of this book in the next article.
